description=UrbanTrace is a toolbox for detecting building footprints in large scale, and analyze their changes in any given spatial units
about=Identifying detailed urban change can help us better understand urban transformations and plan our city more inclusively and sustainably. UrbanTrace is an innovative open-source computer vision toolbox we developed to detect urban changes at the building level using very high-resolution (VHR) aerial imagery. Unlike traditional remote sensing methods focused on large-scale density and land cover change, UrbanTrace tracks the change of each individual urban structure, which can help capture a detailed urban regeneration process. This study demonstrates UrbanTraceâ€™s capabilities by analyzing eight rapidly growing metro areas in the southeastern United States from 2010 to 2020. We tested the stability and generalizability of our tool over an extensive area of more than 35,000 square miles, including nearly 6.5 million buildings. UrbanTrace's robust performance in building footprint extraction and urban change identification highlights its promising applications in helping urban planners track the transformation of urban space and model the potential environmental impact.
